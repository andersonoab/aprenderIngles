In the Far East there was a Great King | No Extremo Oriente havia um Grande Rei

he never grew tired of hearing it, | ele nunca se cansava de escutá-la,
even though many of the stories took hours to complete. | mesmo que muitas histórias levassem horas para acabar.
“There is only one fault with your story,” he often said, | “Há apenas uma falha na sua história,” ele frequentemente dizia,
“it is too short.” | “ela é muito curta.”
All the storytellers in the world were invited to his palace; | Todos os contadores de histórias do mundo eram convidados ao seu palácio;

and some of them told stories that were very long indeed. | e alguns deles contavam histórias que eram de fato muito longas.
